# SaveThePandas

Fashion can be cool, but do you know the implications of it in the society and for the environment?
We felt the duty to help the society in any way we can, so what did we do?
We created SaveThePandas! Here, we will help you get in touch with the community about the best products, but also we want to discover the best products for you and all of us!

For now it only works for iOS, because it was developed natively for it, but stay tuned!

Take a look of how it works:
